## 🧠 Summary

I am a Researcher at Stazione Zoologica Anton Dohrn Napoli, Italy, specializing in underwater object detection using AI. I completed my Ph.D. at the University of Parma, Italy, where I focused on continual learning, few-shot learning, and generative models. I hold a Gold Medal in my bachelor's and received a fellowship for academic excellence during my M.Phil.
