## About Me

I am a Researcher at **Stazione Zoologica Anton Dohrn Napoli**, Italy, specializing in **underwater object detection using AI**. I earned my Ph.D. in Information Technology from the **University of Parma**, Italy, with research focused on **continual learning**, **few-shot learning**, and **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**. I hold multiple distinctions and fellowships, including a **Gold Medal** in my Bachelor's and a fellowship for my M.Phil studies.
